## Temporary Files Management
- ALL temporary documents, status files, notes, drafts, and helper files MUST be created in the `/my` directory
- The `/my` directory path is: /Users/kulia/PycharmProjects/data_wave_billing/my
- This includes but not limited to:
  - Status documents (*.md files for tracking progress)
  - Implementation notes and drafts
  - Temporary scripts and helper files
  - Documentation drafts
  - Any files that are not part of the core application code
- NEVER create temporary files in the project root or any other directory
- If the `/my` directory doesn't exist, create it first before placing files there
- Files in `/my` directory should be excluded from git commits (add to .gitignore if needed)
